Problem 1 
---------
logret = read.delim("d_logret_6stocks.txt")
attach(logret)
1. t.test(AmerExp)
    a. p value is .8516, less than alpha (.05) so True mean of Annex is not equal to 0. Fail to reject Ho
2. wilcox.test(AmerExp)
    a. p value is .3225, true mean of Amex return is not equal to 0. Fail to reject Ho
3.t.test(Pfizer, AmerExp)
    a. p value is .318 so mean returns of Pfizer and Amex are different. Accept Ho
4. wilcox.test(Pfizer, AmerExp)
    a. p value is .1162 so mean return of Pfizer and Amex are different. Accept Ho
5. var.test(Pfizer, AmerExp)
    a. p value is .03896 so variances of Pfizer and Amex are different. Reject Ho




Problem 2
---------

#Initial Ho = The blood pressures for the rats in 26 degrees and 5 degrees are the same u0=u1
#Initial H1 = The blood pressures for the rats in 5 degrees is greater than those in 26 degrees u0>u1
-
#Data Samples are independent because 12 elements in combined sets

> rat26 = c(152, 157, 179, 182, 176, 149)
> rat5 =  c(384, 369, 354, 375, 366, 423)

#Perform Shapiro Test to test Normality of both sets
#Ho for Both: They are Normal
#H1 for Both: They are Not Normal

> shapiro.test(rat26)
> shapiro.test(rat5)

#Both Tests return a p value greater than alpha so fail to reject Ho(They are both normal)

#Test if pooled or unpooled
#Ho = Standard Deviations are Equal
#H1 = Standard Deviations are not Equal

> var.test(rat26, rat5)

#P value is greater than alpha fail to reject Ho, Standard Deviations are Equal (pooled)

> t.test(rat5, rat26, alternative="greater", paired=F, var.equal=T)

#P value is less than alpha therefore reject Ho.
#Blood pressure of rats in 5 degrees is greater than those in 26 degrees

Problem 3
---------
a)

#Initial Ho = The thickness is the same in eyes affected and unaffected by glaucoma u0=u1
#Initial H1 = The thickness is not the same in eyes affected and unaffected u0 != u1

#Data samples are paired because 8 elements in combined set

> affected = c(488, 478, 480, 426, 440, 410, 458, 460)
> unaffected = c(484, 478, 492, 444, 436, 398, 464, 476)

#Perform sharpiro test on difference

#Null hypothesis is paired data is normal
#Alternating Hypothesis is paired data is not normal

> shapiro.test(affected - unaffected).

#p value is greater than alpha(.10), fail to reject Ho.
#Paired data is normal

#Perform t test

> t.test(affected - unaffected, conf.level=.90)

#P value is .3273 which is greater than alpha, fail to reject null hypothesis. 
The thickness is the same in eyes affected and unaffected by glaucoma

b)

The 90% confidence interval computed by the above t test is from -11.196549 3.196549

Problem 4
-----------

#Initial Null Hypothesis = The mean time over the past month is the same as the mean time over the past 5 years. u1 = 25
#Initial Alternating Hypothesis = The meantime over the past month is greater than over the past 5 years u1 > 25

> time = c(28, 25, 27, 31, 10, 26, 30, 15, 55, 12, 24, 32, 28, 42, 38)

#Perform shapiro test to test normality

> shapiro.test(time)

# p value (.4038) is greater than alpha therefore data is normal

#Perform t test 
> t.test(time, mu=25, alternative="greater")
# p value (.1485) is greater than alpha so fail to reject Null hypothesis. 
The meantime over the past month is not greater than over the past 5 years



#Problem 5
------------
attach(logret)

a) With y intercept
> lm(Pfizer~Exxon)

(Intercept)        Exxon  
  -0.005325     0.354649  


b)
Without y intercept
> lm(Pfizer~Exxon-1)

Coefficients:
 Exxon  
0.3183  

c)
Find Correlation, due to NA we use complete.obs
> cor(Pfizer, Exxon, use="complete.obs")

0.3520965

Test if correlation is 0

> cor.test(Exxon, Pfizer)

	Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  Exxon and Pfizer
t = 2.9621, df = 62, p-value = 0.004328
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.1163578 0.5502798
sample estimates:
      cor 
0.3520965 

#p value (.004) is less than alpha, therefore we accept the Alternating hypothesis, correlation is not equal to 0


#Problem 6
----------
a)

> advertising = c(2.4, 1.6, 2.0, 2.6, 1.4, 1.6, 2.0, 2.2)
> sales = c(225, 184, 220, 240, 180, 184, 186, 215)
> cor(advertising, sales)

0.9129053 - Correlation Coefficient

b)
> lm(sales~advertising)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)  advertising  
     104.06        50.73  

Company Sales = 104.06 + 50.73 * Advertising Expenses

c)
> summary(lm(sales~advertising))
  Adjusted R-squared:  0.8056 

d) 
> summary(lm(sales~advertising))
Pr(>|t|) = .0479
It is greater than .01 therefore there is no relationship


e) 104.06 + 50.73 * 1.8 = $195.374 thousand dolloars = $195,374 dollars

Problem 7
---------

library(ISwR)
data(rmr)
attach(rmr)
b = lm(metabolic.rate~body.weight)
expMR = b$coefficients[2]*80 + b$coefficients[1]

Expected Metabolic Rate is 1375.989

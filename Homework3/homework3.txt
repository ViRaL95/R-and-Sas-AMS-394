Exercise 3

If I delete the 19th column the 3 in 35 is moved into Columbia Peaches and the data after that gets distorted in the 
observation. Columns 21-24 will now become 5  6 which is not a number. Columns 25-28 will become 7  1 which is not a number
and will not be recorded as one in the Result. Columns 29-31 will be   1, which will be recorded as a 1 on the Results.
Columns 32-34 will be recorded as   0 2 which will show as a 2 on the output. Columns 35-37 will be recorded as a   1 
which wil be recorded as a 1 on the output.

IF I REMOVE THE @40, this tells SAS to begin Reading 9 columns immediately after The State and Year, 
and will not read the Acerage data completely. In the first column 4,065 will be read in. This can be seen in
